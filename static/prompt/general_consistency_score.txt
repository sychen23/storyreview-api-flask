- there are no contradictions, e.g. if a fact is stated as true, it is not also stated as false
- the point of view in which the story is written stays the same throughout

Here is a story:

What is the consistency score, 0 (not consistent at all) to 100 (extremely consistent)? Output just one number, making sure that the average story has a score of 50.
